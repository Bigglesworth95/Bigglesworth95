- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currentlyformalizing my computer science education via UPenn's MCIT program (relevant projects are private)

Overview: 
This github is a portfolio of many things I've worked on. Anything pre2024 is from App Academy V1; from 2024 onwards is MICT & independent projects. 

How to Read: 
Here, I'll go over what each repo is all about
1. Private repos are relvant to UPenn's MCIT program
2. App Academy V1 is where the vast majority of my work is, as well as my most impressive work. It is divided into 7 branches. 
    A. Chess: This is my most impressive project, in my opinion, because I did it entirely
    on my own with no help or even peeking at the solution
    B. Intro to programming: Just some basic problems and challenges; nothing high-level here (probably nothing high-level anywhere here; but even relative to myself this is basic)
    C. Software engineering foundations: This covers my learning & development of basic principles like OOP and common patterns in algorithmic development. 
    D: Ruby: The most simple stuff you'll find on my profile
    E. Advanced Ruby: This is very rudimentary stuff; not much to look at here. 
    F: SQL: This is where things get more impressive, but it also marks the point where I began to become increasingly frustrated with my learning experience. Support from AA pretty much 
        disappeared at this point, and the solutions became so concise and elegant that they were essentially opaque to an untrained eye when it came to logic and reasoning. 
    G: Rails: A more advanced continuation of SQL
3. App Academy Homework: This is stuff from App Academy V2. I only worked on it for a month or two. It has very basic JS, HTML, and CSS. The V2 curriculum was much less back-end focused it seems. 
4. Ruby: This was before I decided that App Academy V1 was so lengthy that I should keep it all in one repo with different branches for better readability. So this is basically empty and very basic. 
5. HTML: When I was working on AAV1, I thought it might make sense to separate the front end from the back end (until they blended with rails). I later gave up on this idea, so there's not much here. 
6. Practice for unified setup: this was just a git exercise where I was merging files.

And that's it! As you can see, there are a lot of breakages in contributions, and almost everything here was manually uploaded as a zip pre2024. This is because, as an independent learner, it was tough to justify
spending too much time learning git, which is a great way to collaborate, when I never had anyone to collaborate with. Now that I am in a formal learning institution this has changed, 
and I am happy to collaborate with others using git.
