### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on formalizing my computer science education!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning copmuter science principles with the hopes of improving education through technology


Overview: 
This github is basically a portfolio of mostly everything I've worked on that was stored on independent files. It's mostly just App Academy stuff. You'll notice I took a long break starting last Fall when work
got really busy. I then picked things back up again close to the end of the school year, but ended up taking another break because I felt discouraged at my lack of prospects without a formal education. 
That's why I'm trying to overcome that hurdle now!


How to Read: 
Here, I'll go over what each repo is all about
1. App Academy V1 is where the vast majority of my work is, as well as my most impressive work. It is divided into 7 branches. 
    A. Chess: This is my most impressive project, in my opinion, because I did it entirely
    on my own with no help or even peeking at the solution
    B. Intro to programming: Just some basic problems and challenges; nothing high-level here (probably nothing high-level anywhere here; but even relative to myself this is basic)
    C. Software engineering foundations: This covers my learning & development of basic principles like OOP and common patterns in algorithmic development. 
    D: Ruby: The most simple stuff you'll find on my profile
    E. Advanced Ruby: This is very rudimentary stuff; not much to look at here. 
    F: SQL: This is where things get more impressive, but it also marks the point where I began to become increasingly frustrated with my learning experience. Support from AA pretty much 
        disappeared at this point, and the solutions became so concise and elegant that they were essentially opaque to an untrained eye when it came to logic and reasoning. 
    G: Rails: A more advanced continuation of SQL
2. App Academy Homework: This is stuff from App Academy V2. I only worked on it for a month or two. It has very basic JS, HTML, and CSS. The V2 curriculum was much less back-end focused it seems. 
3. Ruby: This was before I decided that App Academy V1 was so lengthy that I should keep it all in one repo with different branches for better readability. So this is basically empty and very basic. 
4. HTML: When I was working on AAV1, I thought it might make sense to separate the front end from the back end (until they blended with rails). I later gave up on this idea, so there's not much here. 
5. Practice for unified setup: this was just a git exercise where I was merging files.

And that's it! As you can see, there are a lot of breakages in contributions, and almost everything here was manually uploaded as a zip. This is because, as an independent learner, it was tough to justify
spending too much time learning git, which is a great way to collaborate, when I never had anyone to collaborate with. I hope to be admitted to a formal learning institution where this will change, 
and I can continue to grow by filling the gaps in my knowledge (of which there must be many). 

If admitted to such an institution, I am also confident that I will be able to shed the mindset issues which have held me back, as it is easy to become plagued with self-doubt when you have no one to turn 
to when things get difficult and when you are unsure if the progress you are making is sufficient to begin a potential career.
